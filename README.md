# Neon Survival
## Project Description
The gameplay of a Couch Co-op prototype. Two players team up to survive as long as possible against waves of oncoming enemies. One player controls the hunted spaceship, whilst the other can control and interact with various objects in the game to help his ally survive. When things get too close, they can switch roles.
